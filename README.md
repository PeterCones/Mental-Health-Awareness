## 🎯 Purpose of the Application

This website is designed for individuals seeking to learn more about mental health while accessing practical advice and curated tips to help manage related challenges.

During the design phase, I envisioned a site with a mystical and calming aesthetic—one that would create a welcoming and safe space for individuals on their mental health journey.

## 🛠️ Implementation

The site was built with a **mobile-first approach**. Responsiveness was achieved using Bootstrap combined with custom CSS media queries.

## 🤖 Use of AI

AI was instrumental in early design phases, including:

- Mocking up demo components
- Creating the carousel with minimal input
- Assisting with idea generation and layout consistency

However, for complex layouts or logic, AI sometimes produced convoluted or inaccurate results, requiring manual refinement.

## 📌 Performance Reflection

Despite efforts to optimize the mobile experience by:

- Adding mobile-specific media queries  
- Reducing image resolution  
- Deferring scripts  
- Applying inline styles  
- Removing animations and images  

...I was unable to significantly boost Lighthouse scores in the available time. This is an area I plan to explore and improve in future projects.
