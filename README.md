### Purpose of application

This website is tailored towards individuals seeking resources to learn more about mental health as well as offering expert advice & tips in managing those areas.

During the design phase of this project, I decieded I wanted the site to look almost mystical, offering an inviting and safe space for individuals seeking help.

### User Stories
With the colour palette deceided upon it, I needed to understand the following:

1. What content do I want to add?
2. How should I structure the content

To help with this I created the following user stories ~

### 1. Greeted with Positive Messaging  
**As a** first-time visitor  
**I want to** be greeted with a positive, calming message in the hero section  
**So that** I feel welcomed and encouraged to explore mental health topics

### Wireframe

With the user stories deceided upon, I built the wireframe for my website using balsamiq:

### Implementation

With a mobile first approach, I made sure all areas were responsive, utilising both bootstrap and CSS media queries to do so.

### Use of AI

AI became very useful when mocking-up very quick demo's of areas I wanted a demonstration of. 

To allow for some AI intergration, I created the courasel using AI, with few inputs from myself:

<img width="2508" height="406" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edac64c0-a3c4-46d0-8599-85e244793ebb" />

This was great as it reduced dev time and allowed me to focus on other areas.

However, with more complex areas, I found AI either became too convoluted in approach, or simply misinterpreted my prompt.

AI also contributed to the design phase & idea gathering elements, helping point me towards consistency & creativity.

### HTML CSS validation
